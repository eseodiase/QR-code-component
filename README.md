## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accessibility
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (developed entirely on mobile device)

### What I learned

This project was an interesting challenge as I completed it entirely on my smartphone. Some key learnings included:

- Working with Figma files for the first time (had to troubleshoot browser compatibility issues)
- Using mobile development tools (Spck editor) for version control with Git/GitHub
- Testing responsive design using screenfly.org
- Discovering new tools like Prettier through Frontend Mentor

```css
/* Responsive styling I implemented */
 .wrapper{
 display: flex;
 justify-content: center;
 align-items: center;
 min-height: 100vh;
 }
```

### Continued development

Areas I want to focus on in future projects:
- Improving my Figma workflow
- Exploring more mobile development tools
- Implementing more advanced CSS techniques
- Transitioning to desktop development environment when possible

### Useful resources

- [Figma Help Center](https://help.figma.com/) - Helped me understand how to extract design information
- [Spck Editor Documentation](https://spck.io/docs) - Essential for mobile development setup
- [Screenfly](https://screenfly.org) - Useful for responsive testing without multiple devices
